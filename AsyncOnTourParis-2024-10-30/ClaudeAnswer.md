I'll help you create an AsyncAPI specification for the Task Management system based on the domain model and event flow shown in the diagrams. I'll focus on defining the key events and their schemas.

I've created a comprehensive AsyncAPI specification based on the domain model and event flow diagrams. Here are the key aspects I've defined:

1. Events Lifecycle:
    - TaskCreated: When a new task is created by the Creator
    - TaskAssigned: When a task is assigned to a Freelancer
    - TaskProcessed: When a task is being worked on (status: IN_PROGRESS)
    - TaskCompleted: When a task is marked as DONE

2. Key Domain Objects:
    - Task with properties matching the domain model (title, description, dueDate)
    - Status transitions (NEW -> ASSIGNED -> IN_PROGRESS -> DONE)
    - Relationships between Creator, Freelancer, and Assignee

3. Message Structure:
    - Consistent headers with correlationId for tracing
    - Specific payloads for each event type
    - Required fields based on the domain model
    - Appropriate validation constraints

Would you like me to:
1. Add more event types or states?
2. Modify the payload structures?
3. Add additional validation rules?
4. Include more metadata in the headers?
