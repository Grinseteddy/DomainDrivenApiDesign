  event-driven / message-driven / pub-sub / streaming API, describe Kafka, MQTT,
  AMQP, WebSocket, or other broker topics, channels, messages, or events, or
  produce an asyncapi.yaml file — even if they don't say "AsyncAPI 3.1.0"
  explicitly. Also use it when adding channels, operations, messages, or schemas

# AsyncAPI 3.1.0 Spec Author

This skill produces AsyncAPI **3.1.0** specifications in **YAML** that follow a
consistent, heavily componentized house style and pass linting. The bundled
`assets/example-task-management.yaml` is the gold-standard reference for what
"good" looks like — when in doubt about structure or formatting, open it and
mirror it.

The conventions below are **strong defaults**: apply them unless the user's
domain clearly calls for something different (a different protocol, a different
security scheme, a request-reply pattern instead of fire-and-forget events).
Adapt thoughtfully rather than forcing every rule, but keep the spec internally
consistent.

## The 3.1.0 mental model (read this first)

AsyncAPI 3.1.0 is **not** OpenAPI and is **not** AsyncAPI 2.x. Three root
sections do the work, and keeping them decoupled is the whole point of the
version:

- **`channels`** — *where* messages flow (a Kafka topic, an MQTT topic, a queue,
  a WebSocket route). A channel declares its `address` and the set of `messages`
  that can appear on it. Channels are reusable and say nothing about direction.
- **`operations`** — *what the application does* with a channel: `action: send`
  or `action: receive`. Operations live at the **root**, not nested under
  channels, and point at a channel via `$ref`.
- **`components.messages`** — the message definitions (`headers` + `payload`),
  referenced by channels.

**`action` is from the perspective of the application described by this
document**, and this is the most common mistake: `send` means *this application
sends/publishes the message to the channel*; `receive` means *this application
consumes/subscribes to the message from the channel*. (This replaces the
confusing 2.x `publish`/`subscribe`, where the verb described the consumer, not
the application.) If the document describes a producer service, its operations
are `send`; for a consumer service, `receive`.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Don't skip validation.

### 1. Understand the event API

Establish, from the conversation or by asking briefly:
- The **events / messages** the system emits or consumes, and the **lifecycle**
  they represent (e.g. `Created → Assigned → Processed → Completed`).
- The **channels** (topics/queues) those messages travel on, and which messages
  share a channel.
- **Direction** for the application being described — does it `send` (produce) or
  `receive` (consume) each message? This decides the `action` on each operation.
- The **protocol** and broker (Kafka, MQTT, AMQP, WebSocket, …) and the server
  host. Default content type is `application/json`.
- **Security** for the broker connection (default: `userPassword`).

If the user already gave a message list, a state machine, an event-storming
result, or an existing spec, extract the channels and messages from that instead
of interrogating them. Ask only what you genuinely can't infer.

### 2. Read the conventions

Before writing, read `references/conventions.md` — it is the authoritative,
detailed specification of the house style (naming, the channel/operation/message
split, the shared message-header pattern, payload schema design, security). The
summary in this file is a reminder, not a substitute.

### 3. Write the spec

Start from `assets/skeleton.yaml` and build outward. Write the file in this order
so structure stays clean:

1. `asyncapi: 3.1.0` + `info` (title, version, description, `contact`).
2. `servers` (host, protocol, description, `security` → a scheme `$ref`).
3. `defaultContentType: application/json`.
4. `channels` — each with an `address` and a `messages` map of `$ref`s to
   `components.messages`.
5. `operations` — one per message flow, each with `action` (`send`/`receive`), a
   `channel` `$ref`, and a `messages` list of `$ref`s.
6. `components` — `messages`, `schemas` (a shared `MessageHeader` plus one
   payload schema per message), `securitySchemes`.

The single most important convention: **componentize and reuse via `$ref`.**
Messages live under `components.messages`; their headers and payloads live under
`components.schemas`; channels reference messages; operations reference channels
and messages — exactly as in the example. Inline as little as possible.

### 4. Validate and lint

Always validate the finished spec. Read `references/validation.md` for the exact
commands. Two complementary tools:

```bash
# Spec conformance (AsyncAPI 3.1.0) — the official parser:
npm install -g @asyncapi/cli
asyncapi validate <spec>.yaml

# House-style governance — Spectral with the bundled ruleset:
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
spectral lint <spec>.yaml --ruleset assets/house-style.spectral.yaml
```

Fix every **error** and review **warnings** (resolve them unless there's a
deliberate reason). Re-run until clean. If neither tool can be installed, fall
back to the Python structural check described in `references/validation.md`.

### 5. Present

Save the final `.yaml` to the outputs directory and present it. Briefly note the
channels, messages, and operations covered and the result of the validation run.

## House style at a glance

A compressed reminder — `references/conventions.md` has the full detail.

**Naming**
- Channel keys, operation keys, message component keys: `camelCase`
  (`taskEvents`, `publishTaskCreated`, `taskCreated`).
- Operation keys are verb + noun: a `send` operation reads as `publish…`, a
  `receive` operation as `consume…`/`on…`.
- Channel `address`: broker-style path, `kebab-case` segments
  (`task-management/tasks`).
- Schema component keys: `PascalCase`, payloads suffixed `Payload`
  (`TaskCreatedPayload`); the shared header schema is `MessageHeader`.
- Message `name`: `PascalCase` (`TaskCreated`); `title`: human-readable
  ("Task Created Event"). Schema properties: `camelCase`.

**info** — `title`, semver `version`, a `description` (`|` block: what the API
does and who uses it), and a `contact` (`name`, `url`, `email`).

**channels** — each declares an `address` and a `messages` map whose keys mirror
the message component keys, each value a `$ref` into `components.messages`. Group
related lifecycle events on one channel when they share a topic.

**operations** — root-level, one per message flow. Each has `action`
(`send` | `receive`), a `channel` `$ref`, and a `messages` list of `$ref`s to the
specific messages it acts on. **Reference those messages _through the channel_**
(`#/channels/<key>/messages/<msg>`), not directly via `#/components/messages/...`
— the latter fails `asyncapi validate`. Add a per-operation `security` block only
when it narrows the server default.

**messages** — each has `name`, `title`, `summary`, `headers` (`$ref` to the
shared `MessageHeader`), and `payload` (`$ref` to its payload schema).

**schemas** — a shared `MessageHeader` (`correlationId`, `messageId`, `source`)
reused by every message, plus one `…Payload` schema per message. Every object
schema is `type: object` with `required` + `properties`. Add constraints
liberally: `format` (`uuid`, `date-time`, `uri`, `email`), `minLength`/
`maxLength`, `minimum`/`maximum`, and `enum` for status fields. Model a state
machine by giving each event's `status` a single-value `enum`
(`NEW`, `ASSIGNED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`).

**security** — define the broker auth scheme once in
`components.securitySchemes` (default `userPassword`) and reference it from each
server's `security` list.
