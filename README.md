# Domain Driven API Design

This repository contains resources and examples which are used throughout training for Domain-Driven API Design.

## Online Library

The sample online library contains interfaces of a demo online library. The interfaces are designed in HTTP REST for synchronous interfaces and in the Kafka Protocol for asynchronous interfaces using events.

The principle architecture approach was developed with domain storytelling and event-storming sessions and is documented on a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNjGcwrQ=/?share_link_id=926523505719).
