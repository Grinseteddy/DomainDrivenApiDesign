# OpenAPI 3.1.0 Spec Author

This skill produces OpenAPI **3.1.0** specifications in **YAML** that follow a
consistent, heavily componentized house style and pass linting. The bundled
`assets/example-catalog-management.yaml` is the gold-standard reference for what
"good" looks like — when in doubt about structure or formatting, open it and
mirror it.

The conventions below are **strong defaults**: apply them unless the user's
domain clearly calls for something different (e.g. a different auth scheme, no
versioning header, an internal-only audience). Adapt thoughtfully rather than
forcing every rule, but keep the spec internally consistent.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Don't skip validation.

### 1. Understand the API

Establish, from the conversation or by asking briefly:
- The **resources** (nouns) the API manages and how they relate (parent/child).
- The **operations** needed per resource (create / read / update / delete / list / search).
- **Auth**: who calls it, what scopes/roles exist (default is OAuth2 with
  read/write/admin scopes).
- **Audience**: public, partner, or internal (drives `x-audience`).

If the user already gave a data model, feature description, or existing spec,
extract the resources from that instead of interrogating them. Ask only what you
genuinely can't infer.

### 2. Read the conventions

Before writing, read `references/conventions.md` — it is the authoritative,
detailed specification of the house style (naming, componentization rules,
schema design, the standard response set, security patterns). The summary in
this file is a reminder, not a substitute.

### 3. Write the spec

Start from `assets/skeleton.yaml` and build outward. Write the file in this
order so structure stays clean:

1. `openapi: 3.1.0` + `info` (with `x-api-id` and `x-audience`) + `servers`.
2. Root `security` + `tags` (one per resource area, each with a description).
3. `paths` — operations that reference everything via `$ref`, inlining as little
   as possible.
4. `components` — `parameters`, `schemas`, `responses`, `requestBodies`,
   `securitySchemes`.

The single most important convention: **componentize and reuse via `$ref`.**
Parameters, request bodies, responses, and any reused schema live under
`components` and are referenced from the paths — exactly as in the example.

### 4. Validate and lint

Always validate the finished spec. Read `references/validation.md` for the exact
commands. In short: lint with Spectral using the bundled ruleset:

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli   # if not already installed
spectral lint <spec>.yaml --ruleset assets/house-style.spectral.yaml
```

Fix every **error** and review **warnings** (resolve them unless there's a
deliberate reason). Re-run until clean. If Spectral can't be installed, fall
back to the Python structural validator described in `references/validation.md`.

### 5. Present

Save the final `.yaml` to the outputs directory and present it. Briefly note the
resources covered and the result of the lint run.

## House style at a glance

A compressed reminder — `references/conventions.md` has the full detail.

**Naming**
- Paths: `kebab-case`, plural collection nouns (`/catalog-entries`), sub-resources
  nested (`/catalog-entries/{catalogEntryId}/tags`).
- Path / query / header parameters: `camelCase`.
- `operationId`: `camelCase`, verb + noun (`createCatalogEntry`, `getCatalogEntryById`).
- Component keys & schema names: `PascalCase`, with role suffixes —
  `...Parameter`, `...Response`, `...Request`.
- Schema properties: `camelCase`.

**info block** — title, a one/two-sentence description (purpose + who uses it),
semver `version`, `contact.name`, a stable UUID `x-api-id` (never changes across
versions), and `x-audience` (`external-public` / `external-partner` /
`company-internal` / `component-internal`).

**Operations** — each has `operationId`, `tags` (must be a defined tag),
`summary` (short imperative), `description` (a `|` block explaining behavior and
side effects), `parameters`/`requestBody`/`responses` via `$ref`, and a
per-operation `security` block only when it narrows the default (e.g. write/admin
scopes for mutations).

**Standard responses** (reuse shared components):
- GET → `200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500`
- POST → `201, 400, 401, 403, 500`
- PUT → `200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500`
- DELETE → `204` (inline description), `400, 401, 403, 404, 500`

All error responses point at a shared `Error` schema (`code`, `message`,
`details`).

**Schemas** — `type: object` with `required` + `properties`. Add constraints
liberally: `minLength`/`maxLength`, `minItems`/`maxItems`, `pattern`, and
`format` (`uuid`, `date-time`, `uri`, `email`, …). Keep **read** models (include
server-generated fields like ids and timestamps) separate from **write** models:
a `...Create` schema (required fields, no server-generated ones) and a
`...Update` schema (all-optional / partial). For nullable fields in 3.1.0 use a
type array, e.g. `type: [string, "null"]`.

**Security** — default is OAuth2 authorization-code flow with PKCE, declared once
in `components.securitySchemes` and referenced at the root, with scopes such as
`read`/`write`/`admin`.

**Versioning** — a required `version` header parameter whose `enum` is locked to
the current version with a matching `default`, referenced by every operation.
