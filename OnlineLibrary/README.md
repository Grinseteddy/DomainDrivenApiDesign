# Online Library

The online library is an idea to explain how important domain-driven design is, when it comes to design understandable and clear APIs independent of the technology behind.
 
During Domain-Storytelling and Event Storming the following bounded contexts were detected, which need APIs:

- Purchase
- Catalog Maintenance
- Identity and Access Management
- Catalog Search
- Messaging
- Member Management
- Reading Service
- Payment

There are APIs defined for all those bounded context. The defined APIs can be REST-APIs as well as Events.
